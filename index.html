                <p>Where to start? Not sure what to put here. I'm not to well at talking about myself.
                        For now I will just put a little about what I have been up to the past few years.
                        I have been a mom since 2013, and a mom of two since 2014. My every day evolved 
                        around making sure my boys were thirving and our home was put together. Now that my
                        oldest is in school, I'm breaking out of the stay at home mom life and doing something
                        for myself. After having a long sit down with my ex husband, he explained to me that I might enjoy
                        being a front end web developer since I am a creative person. I decided to take his advice 
                        and give it a try. Now I am hooked and I have him to thank for his full support.</p>
